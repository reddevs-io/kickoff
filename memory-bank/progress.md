# Progress â€” Kickoff

## What Works
- `kickoff init` command with interactive framework selection prompt
- PHP/Node.js version selection prompt based on project type
- Database requirement prompt with Yes/No option
- Database engine selection (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Other)
- Custom Docker image input for "Other" option
- Database version selection with latest 3 versions for each engine
- Web server selection prompt with conditional options based on project type
- Additional services multi-select prompt with conditional sub-prompts for search engine, caching services, and MailHog
- Project builds successfully
- Basic test structure in place

## What's Left
- Docker Compose template generation
- File writing functionality
- Complete test coverage for new prompts
