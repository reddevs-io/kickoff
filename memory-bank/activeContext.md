# Active Context â€” Kickoff

## Current Focus
- Set up Oclif project structure
- Implement `kickoff init` command

## Recent Changes

## Next Steps

2. Map answers to Docker Compose templates
3. Write generated files to disk

## Active Decisions

- Keep architecture monolithic

## Constraints
- Must run on macOS/Linux with Docker & Docker Compose installed

## Risks
- Docker version differences may cause incompatibility
