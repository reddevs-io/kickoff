# Active Context â€” Kickoff

## Current Focus
- Docker Compose template generation service implementation
- File writing functionality for generated configurations
- Command-line arguments implementation for scriptable usage

## Recent Changes
- Added project name prompt as first question
- Added database requirement prompt
- Added database engine selection (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Other)
- Added custom Docker image input for "Other" option
- Added database version selection with latest 3 versions for each engine
- Added web server selection prompt with conditional options based on project type
- Added PHP/Node.js version selection prompt based on project type
- Added additional services multi-select prompt with conditional sub-prompts for search engine, caching services, and MailHog
- **Implemented Docker Compose template generation service using js-yaml**
- **Added file writing functionality for docker-compose.yml and related directories**

## Next Steps
1. Complete test coverage for Docker Compose generation
2. Add more comprehensive testing for different framework combinations
3. Test edge cases and error handling
4. Document the generated Docker Compose structures

## Active Decisions
- Use Oclif for CLI
- Keep architecture monolithic
- Provide "Other" option for custom Docker images
- Show only latest 3 versions for each database engine
- Use js-yaml for programmatic Docker Compose generation instead of template files
- Generate configuration files dynamically based on user selections

## Constraints
- Must run on macOS/Linux with Docker & Docker Compose installed

## Risks
- Docker version differences may cause incompatibility
